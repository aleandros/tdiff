{"repository_name":"github.com/aleandros/tdiff","body":"# tdiff\n\n[![Built with Crystal](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-crystal-000000.svg?style=flat-square)](https://crystal-lang.org/)\n[![CI](https://github.com/aleandros/tdiff/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aleandros/tdiff/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)\n[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/aleandros/tdiff.svg)](https://github.com/aleandros/tdiff/releases)\n\nA tool for comparing Tree like files, specifically JSON and YAML\n\n## Installation\n\nRight now, simply go to the [releases page](https://github.com/aleandros/tdiff/releases) and download\nthe latest binary to your prefered directory in your path (like `/usr/local/bin`). This applies for both\nwindows and linux\n\nIf you have `snap` on your system, you can install it with\n\n```shell\n$ sudo snap install --beta tdiff # I hope to be able to consider it out of beta soon\n```\n\nIf you want to build it for your platform (specifically, OSX), download crystal and compile it. For example, in OSX:\n\n```shell\n$ brew install crystal\n$ git clone https://github.com/aleandros/tdiff/\n$ cd tdiff && shards build --production --release --no-debug\n```\n\nThe binary will live in `bin/tdiff`. You can move it to your path after that.\n\n## Usage as a binary\n\nUsage: `tdiff [OPTION]... [SOURCE] <TARGET>`\n\nIdentifies the differences between two tree-like file structures.\n\nIf `<TARGET>` is not present, input is assumed to come from STDIN.\nAt this moment, only JSON and YAML are supported.\n\nAn exit status of 1 indicates an error in the program.\nAn exit status of 127 indicates that there are differences between source\nand target.\nAn exit status of 0 indicates no changes\n\nExample output:\n\n```shell\n$ tdiff shard.yml shard.lock\n- name: tdiff\n* version: changed type from string to float\n- authors: [\"Edgar Cabrera <edgar.cabrera@pm.me>\"]\n- targets: {\"tdiff\" => {\"main\" => \"main.cr\"}}\n- crystal: 0.34.0\n- license: MIT\n- development_dependencies: {\"ameba\" => {\"github\" => \"crystal-ameba/ameba\", \"version\" => \"~> 0.12.0\"}}\n+ shards: {\"ameba\" => {\"github\" => \"crystal-ameba/ameba\", \"version\" => \"0.12.1\"}}\n```\n\n## Usage as a shard\n\nAdd it to your application shards:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  tdiff:\n    github: aleandros/tdiff\n```\n\nIt just requires a couple of IO objects, containing the YAML or JSON data, \nand returns a list of `Tdiff:Core::Result` objects.\n\n```crystal\nrequire \"tdiff\"\n\ncomparator = Tdiff.compare(File.open('target_1.yml'), File.open('target_2.yml'))\ncomparator.compare\ncomparator.results.each do |result|\n  puts \"#{result.path.join(\".\")}: #{result.difference.reason}\"\nend\n```\n\nIf any of the inputs cannot be parsed, this method will raise a `Tdiff::Exception` error.\n\n## Development\n\nThis is a pretty standard crystal project. So install crystal with your prefered method.\n\nFirst install dependencies with `shards install`.\n\nRemember to run:\n\n* Tests with `crystal spec`\n* Format with `crystal tool format`\n* Ameba checks with `bin/ameba`\n\nThis will be checked by CI but still save yourself some time.\n\n### Documentation\n\nYou can find the documentation [here](https://aleandros.github.io/tdiff/)\n\n## TODO\n- [x] Compare file to STDIN\n- [x] Compare yamls\n- [x] Compare json\n- [x] Presentation layer\n- [x] Add auto-publish via github actions and installation instructions\n- [ ] Add portable binaries for OSX (or homebrew package)\n- [x] Publish as snap package\n- [x] Add portable binary for Windows\n- [ ] Support more array comparison algorithms\n- [x] Fix file permission testing in CI\n- [ ] Allow presentation-level customizations at runtime\n- [x] Allow `Tdiff::Core` to be used as a library\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Fork it (<https://github.com/aleandros/tdiff/fork>)\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\n5. Create a new Pull Request\n\n## Contributors\n\n- [Edgar Cabrera](https://github.com/aleandros) - creator and maintainer\n","program":{"html_id":"github.com/aleandros/tdiff/toplevel","path":"toplevel.html","kind":"module","full_name":"Top Level Namespace","name":"Top Level Namespace","abstract":false,"superclass":null,"ancestors":[],"locations":[],"repository_name":"github.com/aleandros/tdiff","program":true,"enum":false,"alias":false,"aliased":"","const":false,"constants":[],"included_modules":[],"extended_modules":[],"subclasses":[],"including_types":[],"namespace":null,"doc":null,"summary":null,"class_methods":[],"constructors":[],"instance_methods":[],"macros":[],"types":[{"html_id":"github.com/aleandros/tdiff/Tdiff","path":"Tdiff.html","kind":"module","full_name":"Tdiff","name":"Tdiff","abstract":false,"superclass":null,"ancestors":[],"locations":[{"filename":"exception.cr","line_number":13,"url":"https://github.com/aleandros/tdiff/blob/1ddfe72a2c938aac2279560885f9311dc24595ce/src/exception.cr"},{"filename":"tdiff.cr","line_number":33,"url":"https://github.com/aleandros/tdiff/blob/1ddfe72a2c938aac2279560885f9311dc24595ce/src/tdiff.cr"}],"repository_name":"github.com/aleandros/tdiff","program":false,"enum":false,"alias":false,"aliased":"","const":false,"constants":[{"id":"VERSION","name":"VERSION","value":"\"0.2.1\"","doc":null,"summary":null}],"included_modules":[],"extended_modules":[],"subclasses":[],"including_types":[],"namespace":null,"doc":"Tdiff is a CLI utility for comparing tree-like files (json/yaml).\n\nYou can check out the source code at github: https://github.com/aleandros/tdiff\n\nThere are three main layers to the structure of the application:\n\n* `Tdiff::Arguments` is in charge of handling user input and properly parse\n  the given input files.
